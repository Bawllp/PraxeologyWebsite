                    <h1>Market, Industry, and Competition Analysis</h1>
                    
                    <p> Our market does have some competitors, however, our products are largely differentiated and most competitors such as Stocktwits and Scutify. However, these businesses only draw in half of our consumer market as they are solely targeted towards investors, while we target both investors and business owners and facilitate connection. 
Market type: Monopolistic Competition.
Low barriers to entry so cannot be a monopoly nor an oligopoly.
If not an oligopoly or monopoly, there would be no ability to collude, price fix or participate in a cartel.
Differentiated products so cannot be perfect competition.
While we have some control over price, we cannot price fix as products such as Stocktwits are a close enough (although not perfect) substitute as they serve a similar purpose for half of our target demographic. 
As can be seen by the figure to the left, market competitors utilize a model that allows users to use the product for free receiving revenue from advertisements, also offering a premium account. The price set below follows the demand curve seen by competitors such as Scutify with a premium account costing $50 with almost identical marginal revenue to our business model (almost identical costs of production).
