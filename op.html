    <h1> Operation </h1>
    <p> Praxeology will be an entirely web-based product. We will plan to follow a typical 5 day work week with technical support being run through a 24 hour email routed to our developers until we can establish a technical support division in the long run. In the short run, we anticipate we will only need to hire three developers. This will likely not change until series A. 
While we do not anticipate any litigious issues in the market as our product is significantly differentiated, we have accounted for such pitfalls in our ask and built adequate runway. Similarly, cloud services are largely unpredictable and dependent on traffic and have also been accounted for in our runway. 
CEO Pleasant Ballenger will oversee product development and CFO Jack Ferm will oversee financial operations.
We will offer a free service with limited customization and search options where revenue will be primarily gained through advertisements. However, much of the functionality of the product will be unlocked through a $50 premium account as this price matches the demand of the market.
