                        <p> The product (the app) has no life cycle in itself since it is merely a bulletin between small business advertisements and investors, our company produces nothing.
Advertising will certainly be necessary as our target demographic is large yet specific to those with/desire to start a business or those with the desire to invest. 
Market research: Users on the producing end of our platform will typically be that of small businesses willing to sacrifice shares for a headstart in their market, whereas, the consuming end are primarily venture capitalists, angel investors, and smaller investors willing to engage in this area of E-commerce.
After the app is created we would reach out to investors and small businesses and advertise our product as well as collect input as a means for test marketing our product.
If test marketing is successful we could run advertising campaigns using social media marketing and outlets.
We would however need to occasionally implement some market surveys to gauge the demand for this product over time and see how our consumers react to changes in the app.
Since the product is a web based application there would be no need to navigate whole-sale or retail marketplaces.
All Channels of Distribution take place electronically through the app.
